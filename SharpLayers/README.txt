SharpLayers is an embryonic attempt at wrapping the OpenLayers v2.5 (see http://www.openlayers.org/) web map client in a set of Asp.Net Ajax controls to allow configuration from the server.
As of 05 March 08 it can draw a google map to screen with standard controls but not much more.
Eventually I intend to add state tracking between postbacks - (even though it is an ajax lib somebody somewhere will need a postback for something :o )
I intend to use it to host SharpMap layers / as the basis for a Sharp Map Ajax control. http://www.codeplex.com/SharpMap 
For the foreseeable future this project is not likely to change much as I am working on the SharpMap rendering.
